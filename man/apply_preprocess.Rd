\usage{
apply_preprocess(
  s,
  in_memory = TRUE,
  write_data = FALSE,
  file = NULL,
  ncores = NULL,
  BPPARAM = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{s}{Spectra object}

\item{in_memory}{logical. `in_memory` is `TRUE` keeps the peaks data in memory using
a [Spectra::MsBackendDataFrame]. If `FALSE`, peaks data are kept on disk
un a MzML file using the [Spectra::MsBackendMzR]. If `FALSE`, `write_data` is
overridden and the spectra is written to file.}

\item{write_data}{logical. Whether to write spectra data into a file
This will apply processing, export spectra into mzML file(s) and
reload into a new Spectra object with MsBackendMzR. This is useful
if we want to apply preprocessing and the resulting object is still
too big to keep in memory, either because there are too many spectra
or because we still haven't picked peaks.}

\item{file}{If `write_data` is `TRUE`, or `in_memory` is `FALSE`,
required file or files to write spectra.
IF there is one file, all spectra is saved on the same file.
If multiple files, there needs to be one per spectra.}

\item{ncores}{Number of cores for parallel processing of the newly created
Spectra object. It can also be specified using ncores in the metadata
slot of `s`. If both are specified, the value of the function argument
takes precedence.
If both are `NULL`, it is set to the maximum available cores - 2
with `parallel::detectCores() - 2`. See [parallel::detectCores()]}

\item{BPPARAM}{bpparam of the newly created Spectra object. Default is
[BiocParallel::MulticoreParam] with `ncores`.}
}
\value{
A Spectra object with either [Spectra::MsBackendMzR] (`in_memory=FALSE`) or
[Spectra::MsBackendMemory] (`Ã¬n_memory=TRUE`) backends
}
